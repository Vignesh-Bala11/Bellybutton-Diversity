# Bellybutton-Diversity

## Overview 
This project analyzes data related to belly button biodiversity. By using HTML and Javascript's Plotly and D3 libraries, I have created a dashboard to present the top 10 bateria cultures found in a participant's belly button, all of the bateria cultures found in their belly button, and their weekly washing freqency. Here is a link to the dashboard via GitHub Pages: https://vignesh-bala11.github.io/Bellybutton-Diversity/
